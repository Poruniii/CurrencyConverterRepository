# CurrencyConverterRepository
####Introduction
This project has a total of three main codes and seven design codes. This README file will detail all the necessary functions of the whole program.
###Main Codes
There are three main codes, HelloController.java or the Controller file, CallRates.java or the Table for Rates file, and HelloApplication or the application runner that runs the whole code.
HelloController houses the functions of the GUI and the output of the program. Each function in the Controller is labeled with a comment besides the beginning of the code line.
CallRates calls the Rates inside the file. There we can modify and change the exchange rates of each currency.
  		HelloApplication runs the code.
####Design Codes
  	//This is hard to explain in text so bear with me until I show it to you fully in Scene builder.//
The Design codes can be broken down to CSS and FXML. Most of the code is in CSS and only one FXML file. FXML file is short for JavaFX Markup Language, it kind of resembles an HTML code but slightly different.
FXML file holds all the Library or items we design in Scene builder, Scene Builder is another application that lets user create the GUI they desire.
To be able to apply design in scene bulder we can use Style Sheets. Hard coded Style Sheets are built in within Scene Builder and can cause issues with the design when modifying. I suggest that all design elemnts be in CSS.
To change the behaviour or code of the items, we can modify it in the FXML file, we can add and erase some features of the item. This modification is also possible in Scene Builder. It is up to you which is easier to use.
####Additional Information
  	Made in Intellij.
  	GUI is made in Scene Builder.
  	CSS fles can be found in NotePad or VsCode.
  	Deleting some of the files in Intellij might cause issues so I suggest don't delete.
  	There is a blank java file that I didn't use, don't delete.
